to build Ai voice agents that can talk like real human... they can book meetings , do customer service and thes things you know... so pretty 
basic and easy,, now let me show you how it works..."
From 21 to 41 seconds we are talking about how vapi ai works.
say this .."so you see this sounds all cool... but like how does it actually work?
well don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî i got you.

vapi connects your voice agent to two things:
üëâ one is a language model (like GPT, that does the ‚Äúthinking‚Äù)
üëâ and the other is a phone line (so it can actually talk to people)

you just tell it what kind of agent you want ‚Äî like a receptionist, an appointment setter, a support rep ‚Äî
and boom üí• it starts taking and making calls, in real time.

you control everything: the voice, the script, how it responds, even what tools it can use.
so yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs basically like building a call center, but with zero humans and all AI."
